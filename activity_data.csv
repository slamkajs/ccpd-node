Several recently reported clinical trials are refining our understanding of how to optimize anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing thrombolysis for STEMI.  In addition, the results of trials such as DANAMI-2 and C-PORT have shed further light on the value of primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) in this clinical setting.
